AI-Based Anti-Recording System (YOLOv8)
This project is an AI-powered anti-recording system that uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) to detect mobile phones in real-time and automatically 
activates Infrared (IR) lights through an Arduino board. This system prevents unauthorized recording in restricted or confidential areas.

Features
Real-time Mobile Phone Detection using YOLOv8.
Automatic IR LED Activation when a phone is detected.
Arduino Integration to control IR LEDs via serial communication.
High Accuracy detection with YOLOv8 object detection.
Privacy Protection in examination halls, secure offices, or private meetings.
Low Power Usage â€“ IR lights activate only when needed.
